• Summary of your user research:
<br>
According to our research conducted with students from different universities, we have concluded user research which states below: 

1. Time Constraints Impact Cooking Behavior: Busy schedules significantly impact cooking behavior, leading some interviewees to opt for quick and convenient meal options, while others prioritize making time for cooking.<br>
2. Perceptions of Cooking: Perceptions of cooking vary widely, influencing attitudes toward meal preparation, recipe selection, and experimentation with new dishes.<br>
3. Resource Availability: Limited resources, such as time, budget, and kitchen amenities, influence cooking habits and preferences, underscoring the importance of accessibility in meal preparation. Also, Tallahassee's status as a college town with a smaller international population compared to major metro cities like New York or Chicago significantly impacts the availability of international restaurants and grocery shops.<br>
4. Recommendations: Suggested offering simplified recipes, cooking classes, and resources for sourcing authentic ingredients to support students' cooking endeavors. knowing a substitution ingredient for a dish would be helpful.
